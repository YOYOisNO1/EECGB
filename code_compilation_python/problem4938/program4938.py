    DP-solution.
    
    For each state (v, k, x, v_is_last_letter) we trial a step along the v, k and x
    axes and check that
    dp[future_state] = min(dp[future_state], dp[state] + cost_of_move)
    Hence this implicitly reults in the one with least cost.
    
    V, K, X are arrays that contain the number of occurences of v, k, x at the i'th
    index of s.

        ss = s[0:ss_ind-1]
        And then we cound the number of occurences of V, K, X in this substring.
